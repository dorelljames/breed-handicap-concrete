        Service dogs play a vital role in the lives of people with disabilities,
        ranging from autism to muscular dystrophy. These loving animals help
        their owners perform day-to-day tasks, and some are specially trained
        for people with diabetes, epilepsy, or PTSD. Service dogs play an
        important practical role in the lives of their partners, but they also
        become loving friends. In this blog, we’ll define what a service dog is,
        review common breeds used, and examine the types of service dogs
        available. We’ll also review the benefits of service dogs for people
        with disabilities.
